# Testing github pages

This is to test github pages and relations between pages. 

You can either create a url as `./dir/page.md` or `./dir/page/index.md`. Both of these would work for a link to `./dir/page`. 

* [subpage](./subpage)
* [subpage](./subpage/subpage)
* [absolute](/tmp/subpage/subpage)
